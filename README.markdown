# FreeSWITCH TTS Voice Prompt Generator

This [toolkit](https://github.com/jpawlowski/freeswitch-sounds-tts) made by [jpawlowski](https://github.com/jpawlowski) provided voice prompt file generation via Google Translate and Bing Translate Text-To-Speech engines (TTS) for [FreeSWITCH](http://www.freeswitch.org). This is an update in order to remove deprecated Bing Translate and Google Translate TTS, and replace it instead with Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Speech Service TTS. Also, spanish language has been extended.
